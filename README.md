# Preparations:

I used Visual Studio Code to run these codes, make sure to have Node.js installed.

In your Command Prompt, set your directory as the `Puppeteer` folder, then type `npm install puppeteer`.

`Read_data.R` is run in RStudio. If you want to use a different way to check the data, that's also fine.

All data scraped will be located in `Data` folder.

`Save_out_data` folder is there to save different versions of scraped data.
